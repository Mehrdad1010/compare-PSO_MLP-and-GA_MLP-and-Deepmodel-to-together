In this project, I have implemented three strategies to generate synthetic logs in the oil and gas industry.
My input data consists of cheaper log measurements, and my target is to create NPHI logs.
The three models I developed include a deep learning model using CNN1D, as well as PSO and GA optimization techniques applied to neural networks.
Specifically, PSO is used for optimizing a neural network, and GA is used for optimizing a neural network as well.
